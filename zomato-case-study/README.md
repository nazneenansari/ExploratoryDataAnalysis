## General Information
  #### Problem Statement
In the highly competitive Indian restaurant industry, businesses struggle to optimize their sales and maintain high customer ratings. Several factors, such as location, cuisine type, and service offerings (dine-in, takeaway, delivery, ambiance, pricing, etc.), play a critical role in influencing customer preferences and overall business performance.

However, it remains unclear which factors have the most significant impact on revenue generation and customer satisfaction across different regions. For example:

- Do restaurants in urban centers perform better due to higher footfall, or do suburban outlets with lower operational costs see better profitability?
- Which cuisines dominate in specific areas, and how does pricing affect sales performance?
- Do additional services like online ordering, loyalty programs, or premium dining experiences lead to better ratings and repeat customers?

 #### Dataset
The data was collected using the Zomato API and has information about the Restaurant name, Location, Cuisine, Ratings and other demographics wherein each restaurant is identified uniquely by an ID.

## Conclusions
- Zomato has it’s major grip on Northern part of India — majorly New Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida.
- The most ordered cuisine are the Indian and Chinese cuisine but the highly voted cuisine are the American and Italian ones which can be a strong area for Zomato to grow.
- Restaurants which provide services like Booking table online and Ordering online can have a higher chance of success compared to others.
- Customers rate majority restaurants as Average or have Not Rated so this can not be considered as a strong factor to discuss the success of a restaurant.
